## Swagger
### An easy yet powerful framework for RESTful APIs design

---

## Agenda

1. What is Swagger
2. Swagger ecosystem demo
3. Integration with AWS Lambda demo

---

## What is Swagger

Everything in Swagger is built around Swagger file.

* Basically a YAML/JSON file of predefined syntax
--

* Now incorporated to global OpenAPI specification standard
--

* Currently version 2.0. Versions 2.1 and 3 are in development
--

* Swagger is not only a syntax standard but also a set of tools to work with it

---

## An example of Swagger file

```YAML
  swagger: "2.0"
  info:
    version: "1.0.0"
    title: "Swagger Petstore"
    description: "A sample API that uses a petstore as an example to demonstrate features in the swagger-2.0 specification"
    termsOfService: "http://swagger.io/terms/"
    contact:
      name: "Swagger API Team"
    license:
      name: "MIT"
  host: "petstore.swagger.io"
  basePath: "/api"
  schemes:
    - "http"
  consumes:
    - "application/json"
  produces:
    - "application/json"
```

## An example of Swagger file
```YAML
  paths:
    /pets:
      get:
        description: "Returns all pets from the system that the user has access to"
        produces:
          - "application/json"
        responses:
          "200":
            description: "A list of pets."
            schema:
              type: "array"
              items:
                $ref: "#/definitions/Pet"
  definitions:
    Pet:
      type: "object"
      required:
        - "id"
        - "name"
      properties:
        id:
          type: "integer"
          format: "int64"
        name:
          type: "string"
        tag:
          type: "string"
```

---

## Swagger UI

Converts Swagger file into beautiful interactive documentation available for customization.

---

### Swagger Editor
WYSIWYG web editor for YAML files

--

### CodeGen
Generate clients and server stubs on the fly directly from the YAML files.

--

### Validator
Validate your YAML/JSON files while developing

--

### Swagger Hub
Commercial tool. Whole main Swagger functionality integrated into one project. Whole main Swagger functionality integrated into one project. Publish your API, collectively work on it, deploy it to AWS or elsewhere.

---

## Third-party tools

- Generate mock for your API
- Generate Swagger files from annotations inside of your project
- Integrate Swagger with languages and frameworks
- Lots of other applications on [Swagger integrations page](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/)
